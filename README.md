# Pulsar
Pulsar is an app by Alles.

## Config Directory
The config directory contains Electron data, but it also has some files that directly affect Pulsar. `theme.css` is loaded into Pulsar and can be used for custom theming, and `api` will override the default API origin, which is useful for development. `credentials.json` contains the credentials for the Pulsar client.
