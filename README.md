# Alles Server Discord Bot
The discord bot for managing stuff in our server. Not to be confused with the [public discord bot](https://alles.link/discordbot).

There are lots of commands, including `alles:link` which allows you to connect your AllesID to your discord account, and `alles:xp` which give you 5xp. This can be run once an hour, and the server owner will also get 1xp if their account is connected.
